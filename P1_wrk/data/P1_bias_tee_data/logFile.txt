Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with no DC path to ground (topology corrected): 2


SP SP1[1] <P1_lib:P1_bias_tee:schematic>   freq=(0 Hz->1 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/SHEETAL/Documents/6thSem/Solid_State_Microwave/AFIC901N_DRIVER_SP.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
